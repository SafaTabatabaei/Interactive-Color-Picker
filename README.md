# ðŸŽ¨ Interactive Color Picker in Jupyter Notebook

## Project Overview

This project showcases an interactive color picker developed using the ipywidgets library, designed to run seamlessly within a Jupyter Notebook environment. It allows users to dynamically select and visualize colors by adjusting Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) values, instantly displaying the corresponding hexadecimal code and a live color swatch.

## âœ¨ Key Features & Technologies

-   *Interactive UI:* Utilizes ipywidgets for a responsive and engaging user interface directly within Jupyter cells.
-   *Real-time Visualization:* Displays the selected color in a dedicated HTML box and updates RGB/HEX codes dynamically as sliders are adjusted.
-   *Accessibility:* Simple and intuitive sliders for precise color selection.
-   *Jupyter Integration:* Demonstrates how to build interactive tools for data exploration and presentation in a notebook setting.

*Technologies Used:*
Python | ipywidgets | Jupyter Notebook | HTML/CSS (for display)

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

1.  *Clone the repository:*
    bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Interactive-Color-Picker-Jupyter.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Interactive-Color-Picker-Jupyter.git)
    cd Interactive-Color-Picker-Jupyter
    
    (Replace YourUsername with your actual GitHub username)

2.  *Install dependencies:*
    bash
    pip install ipywidgets
    jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
    
    *Important:* After running the nbextension command, you must *Restart your Jupyter Kernel* for the changes to take effect.

3.  *Run the Jupyter Notebook:*
    bash
    jupyter notebook color_picker.ipynb
    
    (Replace color_picker.ipynb with your notebook's actual filename)

## âœ… Visual Demonstration

(IMPORTANT:* This is where you shine! Add screenshots or, even better, a *GIF/short video* showing the interactivity.)*

(You can record your screen while interacting with the sliders and convert it to a GIF. Online tools like ezgif.com can help.)

## ðŸ’¡ Learnings & Applications

-   Gained practical experience with ipywidgets for creating interactive data applications.
-   Explored dynamic UI design within a Jupyter environment.
-   Understood how to integrate Python logic with front-end (HTML/CSS) elements in a notebook.
-   This approach can be extended to build interactive dashboards, data filters, or simulation controls directly in research notebooks
